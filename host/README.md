CST Base station host code
==========================

Two projects here:

- "cstbase-lib" -- contains the C library and "cstbase-tool" commandline app

- "cstbase-timeset" -- simple example of out to use the library


To build either, just go into that directory and type "make".
To build "cstbase-timeset", be sure to "make" the "cstbase-lib" first.
